## Tools & Access

Goal: To help bring you, our new data analyst, up to speed in the GitLab Data Team's analytics stack as efficiently as possible, without sacrificing quality for speed. 

- [ ] Manager: Add to Analytics API user.
- [ ] Manager: Add to Stitch. 
- [ ] Manager: Request addition to `@datateam` alias on Slack in PeopleOps Onboarding issue
- [ ] Manager: Request addition to `Data Team` 1password vault in PeopleOps Onboarding issue
- [ ] Manager: Invite to `data-team` channel on Slack.
- [ ] Manager: Add to daily Geekbot standup
- [ ] Manager: Add to Snowflake [following Readme Process](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics#managing-roles-for-snowflake). 
- [ ] Manager: Add [future grant](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/sql/grant-privilege.html) to analytics schema to user with `grant select on future tables in schema analytics to role [username]`. You will need to be using the `sysadmin` [role](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/security-access-control-configure.html#assigning-future-grants-on-objects).
- [ ] Manager: Inform new hire what his/her/they scratch schema will be called. **Do not create the schema**, as this will lead to conflicts when dbt runs.

WELCOME TO THE TEAM! WE'RE SO EXCITED TO HAVE YOU!!!

- [ ] Read (skim) through this full issue, just so you have a sense of what's coming. 
- [ ] Join the following channels on Slack: `analytics`, `analytics-pipelines`, and `business-operations`.
- [ ] Schedule a recurring monthly skip level meeting with the Director of Business Operations.
- [ ] Schedule a coffee chat with each member of the team. These should be in addition to the ones you do with other GitLab team members.
- [ ] Read the following pages of the handbook in their entirety. Bookmark them as you should soon be making MR's to improve our documentation!
   - [ ] [Data Team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/)
   - [ ] [Business Operations](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/)
   - [ ] [Data Quality Process](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-quality-process/)
- [ ] Watch @tlapiana's [talk at DataEngConf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu623QBwakc) that gives a phenomenal overview of how the team works.
- [ ] Watch [this great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prcz0ubTAAg) on what Analytics is 
- [ ] Create a new issue in the Analytics project (this project). As you proceed and things are unclear, document it in the issue. Don't worry about organizing it; just brain dump it into the issue! This will help us iterate on the onboarding process.
- [ ] We suggest installing [iTerm2](http://iterm2.com) for use, over the Terminal. No pressure though.
- [ ] Get setup with Python locally. We suggest using the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) as it will come pre-packaged with most everything we use.


Our data stack looks roughly like this:
<img src = "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*BogoeTTK1OXFU1hPfUyCFw.png">

As you read in the handbook, we currently use Stitch and Meltano for extracting data from its raw sources and loading it into our Snowflake data warehouse. We use open source dbt (more on this in a moment) as our transformation tool. The bulk of your projects and tasks will be in dbt , so we will spend a lot of time familiarizing yourself with those tools and then dig into specific data sources. 

## Connecting to Snowflake
- [ ] Follow the instructions at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/#warehouse-access
- [ ] Download a SQL development tool that is compatible with Snowflake, such as [SQLWorkbench/J](http://sql-workbench.net) or [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/). If you're interested in DataGrip, follow the [instructions to get a JetBrains license in the handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/#jetbrains). Alternatively, Snowflake has a Web UI for querying the data warehouse that can be found under [Worksheets](https://gitlab.snowflakecomputing.com/console#/internal/worksheet).
   - [ ] If using the Snowflake Web UI, update your role to `TRANSFORMER`, warehouse to `TRANSFORMING`, and database to `ANALYTICS`. The schema does not matter because your query will reference the schema. 
   - [ ] If using DataGrip, you may need to download the [Driver](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/jdbc-download.html#downloading-the-driver).
   - [ ] This template may be useful as you're configuring the DataGrip connection to Snowflake `jdbc:snowflake://{account:param}.snowflakecomputing.com/?{password}[&db={Database:param}][&warehouse={Warehouse:param}][&role={Role:param}]` We recommend not setting your schema so you can select from the many options.

## dbt

### What is dbt?
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), which we use for transformations in the data warehouse, as it gives us a way to source control the SQL. 
- [ ] Refer to http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/ as a resource for understanding Jinja which is used extensively in dbt.
- [ ] [This article](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/what-exactly-is-dbt-47ba57309068) talks about the what/why.
- [ ] [This introduction](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction) should help get you understand what dbt is.
- [ ] Read [how we use dbt](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics#dbt), especially our coding conventions.
- [ ] Watch [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZuieqqejDd2HkvhEZeOPd6f2Vd5JWyUn/view) of Taylor introducing Chase to dbt.
- [ ] Peruse the [Official Docs](https://docs.getdbt.com).
- [ ] In addition to using dbt to manage our transformations, we use dbt to maintain [our own internal documentation](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/dbt/snowflake/#!/overview) on those data transformations. This is a public link. We suggest bookmarking it. 
- [ ] Read about and and watch [Drew demo dbt docs to Emilie & Taylor](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/using-dbt-docs-fae6137da3c3). Read about [Scaling Knowledge](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/scaling-knowledge-160f9f5a9b6c) and the problem we're trying to solve with our documentation.
- [ ] Consider joining [dbt slack](https://slack.getdbt.com) (Not required, but strongly recommended).
- [ ] Information and troubleshooting on dbt is sparse on Google & Stack Overflow, we recommend the following sources of help when you need it: 
   * Your teammates! We are all here to help!
   * dbt slack has a #beginners channel and they are very helpful.
   * [Fishtown Analytics Blog](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com)
   * [dbt Discourse](http://discourse.getdbt.com)


### Getting Set up with dbt locally
- [ ] Install dbt via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) with `brew tap fishtown-analytics/dbt` and `brew install dbt`.
- [ ] Run `dbt --version` to know you've successfully installed dbt. 
- [ ] In your root directory, please run `mkdir .dbt`. Then create a `profiles.yml` file that looks as follow:
```  
gitlab-snowflake: 
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: snowflake
      threads: 8
      account: gitlab
      user: %%YOUR USER%%
      password: %%YOUR PASSWORD%%
      role: TRANSFORMER
      database: ANALYTICS
      warehouse: TRANSFORMING
      schema: %%YOUR SCRATCH%%
```
- All dbt commands need to be run within the analytics project, specifically you must be in `analytics/transform/snowflake-dbt` or below. 
- [ ] Run `dbt compile` to know that your connection has been successful, you are in the correct location, and everything will run smoothly. 
- [ ] When you are ready to start working with dbt start by running `dbt deps` and doing a `dbt run`. This will take some time (estimate 1 hour, though it could be longer) the first time it runs. 

Here is your dbt commands cheat sheet:
 * `dbt compile` - compiles all models
 * `dbt run` - regular run
 * `dbt run --models modelname` - will only run modelname
 * `dbt run --models +modelname` - will run modelname and all the models it depends on
 * `dbt run --models modelname+` - will run modelname and all the models that depend on it
 * `dbt run --models +modelname+` - will run modelname, all the models it depends on, and all the models that depend on it
 * `dbt run --exclude modelname` - will run all models except modelname
 * `dbt run --full-refresh` - will refresh incremental models
 * `dbt test` - will run custom data tests and schema tests; TIP: `dbt test` takes the same `--model` and `--exclude` syntax referenced for `dbt run`
 * `dbt docs generate` - will generate files for docs
 * `dbt docs serve` - will serve the dbt docs locally

## Snowflake SQL
Snowflake SQL is probably not that different from the dialects of SQL you're already familiar with, but here are a couple of resources to point you in the right direction:
- [ ] [Differences we found while transition from Postgres to Snowflake](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/issues/645)
- [ ] [How Compatible are Redshift and Snowflakeâ€™s SQL Syntaxes?](https://medium.com/@jthandy/how-compatible-are-redshift-and-snowflakes-sql-syntaxes-c2103a43ae84)
- [ ] [Snowflake Functions](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/functions-all.html)

## Misc
