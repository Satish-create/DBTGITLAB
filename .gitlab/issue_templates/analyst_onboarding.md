- [ ] Watch [this great talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prcz0ubTAAg) on what Analytics is
- [ ] Create a new issue in the Analytics project (this project). As you proceed and things are unclear, document it in the issue. Don't worry about organizing it; just brain dump it into the issue! This will help us iterate on the onboarding process.

**Getting your computer set up locally**
* Make sure that you have [created your SSH keys](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-your-ssh-keys.html) prior to running this. You can check this by typing `ssh -T git@gitlab.com` into your terminal which should return "Welcome to GitLab, " + your_username
* THE NEXT STEPS SHOULD ONLY BE RUN ON YOUR GITLAB-ISSUED LAPTOP. If you run this on your personal computer, we take no responsibility for the side effects.
* [ ] Open your computer's built-in terminal app. Run the following:
```
curl https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/raw/master/admin/onboarding_script.sh > ~/onboarding_script.sh
bash ~/onboarding_script.sh
rm ~/onboarding_script.sh
```
   * This may take a while, and it might ask you for your password (multiple times) before it's done. Here's what this does:
      * Installs iTerm, a mac-OS terminal replacement
      * Installs Atom, an open source text editor. Atom is reccomended because of its support for dbt autocompletion.
      * Installing dbt, the open source tool we use for data transformations.
      * Installing goto, an easy way to move through the file system. [Please find here more details on how to use goto](https://github.com/iridakos/goto)
      * Installing anaconda, how we recommend folks get there python distribution.
   * You will be able to `goto analytics` from anywhere to go to the analytics repo locally (you will have to open a new terminal window for `goto` to start working.)
   * You will be able to `gl_open` from anywhere within analytics to open the repo in the UI.
   * Your default python version should now be python 3.
      * Typing `which python` into a new terminal window should now return `/usr/local/anaconda3/bin/python`

Our data stack looks roughly like this:
<img src = "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*BogoeTTK1OXFU1hPfUyCFw.png">

As you read in the handbook, we currently use Stitch for extracting data from its raw sources and loading it into our Snowflake data warehouse. We use open source dbt (more on this in a moment) as our transformation tool. The bulk of your projects and tasks will be in dbt , so we will spend a lot of time familiarizing yourself with those tools and then dig into specific data sources.

**Bonus**
To see the inspiration for the onboarding script you just ran, take a look at the dbt Discourse post [here](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-set-up-our-computers-for-working-on-dbt-projects/243) on how they set up their computers for working on dbt projects.

## Connecting to Snowflake
- [ ] Login with the credentials that your manager created following the instruactions at https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/#warehouse-access
- [ ] Download a SQL development tool that is compatible with Snowflake, such as [SQLWorkbench/J](http://sql-workbench.net) or [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/). If you're interested in DataGrip, follow the [instructions to get a JetBrains license in the handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/#jetbrains). Alternatively, Snowflake has a Web UI for querying the data warehouse that can be found under [Worksheets](https://gitlab.snowflakecomputing.com/console#/internal/worksheet).
   - [ ] If using the Snowflake Web UI, update your role to `TRANSFORMER`, warehouse to `ANALYST_XS`, and database to `ANALYTICS` (located in the top right corner of the worksheet UI). The schema does not matter because your query will reference the schema.
   - [ ] If using DataGrip, you may need to download the [Driver](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/user-guide/jdbc-download.html#downloading-the-driver).
   - [ ] This template may be useful as you're configuring the DataGrip connection to Snowflake `jdbc:snowflake://{account:param}.snowflakecomputing.com/?{password}[&db={Database:param}][&warehouse={Warehouse:param}][&role={Role:param}]` We recommend not setting your schema so you can select from the many options.

## dbt

### What is dbt?
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), which we use for transformations in the data warehouse, as it gives us a way to source control the SQL.
- [ ] Refer to http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/templates/ as a resource for understanding Jinja which is used extensively in dbt.
- [ ] [This article](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/what-exactly-is-dbt-47ba57309068) talks about the what/why.
- [ ] [This introduction](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction) should help get you understand what dbt is.
 [ ] [This podcast](https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/dbt-data-analytics-episode-81/) is a general walkthrough of dbt/interview with its creator, Drew Banin.
- [ ] Read [how we use dbt](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/#-transformation) and our [SQL Style Guide](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/sql-style-guide/).
- [ ] Watch [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZuieqqejDd2HkvhEZeOPd6f2Vd5JWyUn/view) of Taylor introducing Chase to dbt.
- [ ] Peruse the [Official Docs](https://docs.getdbt.com).
- [ ] In addition to using dbt to manage our transformations, we use dbt to maintain [our own internal documentation](https://gitlab-data.gitlab.io/analytics/dbt/snowflake/#!/overview) on those data transformations. This is a public link. We suggest bookmarking it.
- [ ] Read about and and watch [Drew demo dbt docs to Emilie & Taylor](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/using-dbt-docs-fae6137da3c3). Read about [Scaling Knowledge](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com/scaling-knowledge-160f9f5a9b6c) and the problem we're trying to solve with our documentation.
- [ ] Consider joining [dbt slack](https://slack.getdbt.com) (Not required, but strongly recommended).
- [ ] Information and troubleshooting on dbt is sparse on Google & Stack Overflow, we recommend the following sources of help when you need it:
   * Your teammates! We are all here to help!
   * dbt slack has a #beginners channel and they are very helpful.
   * [Fishtown Analytics Blog](https://blog.fishtownanalytics.com)
   * [dbt Discourse](http://discourse.getdbt.com)


### Getting Set up with dbt locally
- All dbt commands need to be run within the analytics project (which you can get to my typing `goto analytics` from anywhere on your Mac, specifically you must be in `analytics/transform/snowflake-dbt` or below.
- [ ] From the command line run `atom ~/.dbt/profiles.yml` and update this file with your info.
- [ ] When you are ready to start working with dbt start by running `dbt deps` and doing a `dbt run --models modelname`. This will take some time (estimate 1 hour, though it could be longer) the first time it runs. Ask your manager what to substitute in `modelname`.
- [ ] Run `dbt compile` to know that your connection has been successful, you are in the correct location, and everything will run smoothly.

Here is your dbt commands cheat sheet:
 * `dbt compile` - compiles all models
 * `dbt run` - regular run
 * `dbt run --models modelname` - will only run modelname
 * `dbt run --models +modelname` - will run modelname and all the models it depends on
 * `dbt run --models modelname+` - will run modelname and all the models that depend on it
 * `dbt run --models +modelname+` - will run modelname, all the models it depends on, and all the models that depend on it
 * `dbt run --exclude modelname` - will run all models except modelname
 * `dbt run --full-refresh` - will refresh incremental models
 * `dbt test` - will run custom data tests and schema tests; TIP: `dbt test` takes the same `--model` and `--exclude` syntax referenced for `dbt run`
 * `dbt docs generate` - will generate files for docs
 * `dbt docs serve` - will serve the dbt docs locally
 * `dbt_run_changed` - a function we've added to your computer that only runs models that have changed
 * `cycle_logs` - a function we've added to your computer to clear out the dbt logs
 * `open_dbt_docs` - a function we've added to your computer to open a local version of dbt docs (reflective of your branch) in one command

## Snowflake SQL
Snowflake SQL is probably not that different from the dialects of SQL you're already familiar with, but here are a couple of resources to point you in the right direction:
