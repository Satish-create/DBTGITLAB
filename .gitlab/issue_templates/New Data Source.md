## Integration Preparation 

<!--
Sufficient access needs to be granted and verified before we can begin working on an automated extraction
--->

**Will there need to be access granted in order for a Data Engineer to extract this data? (example: New permissions or credentials to Salesforce in order to access the data)**
  - [ ] Yes 
  - [ ] No
  - [ ] I don't know

**If Yes:**
- Prioritise giving access to a service account rather than any individual Data Engineer, if uncertain on which account to 
use contact the Data Engineer assigned below for confirmation.  
- Where will access be required? 
- Link to Access Request: <!-- This can be blank to start, will need to be added for prioritization -->


## Data Engineer tasks**
**API** 
  * [ ] If using one of our third party API handlers (Stitch/FiveTran) the integration should be confirmed to be up and running
  * [ ] If writing a custom API integration the API endpoints should be confirmed to be active and returning expected data. 
 

**Admin**
  * [ ] Create issue for creation of extract process (not needed if using Stitch/FiveTran)
  * [ ] Create issue for dbt models 
  * [ ] Create and link merge requests for updating relevant documentation 

## Data Use / Acceptance Criteria 

**Who should be responsible for making the data accessible and usable in the data warehouse?**
- Analyst: <!-- please tag them -->
- Data Engineer: <!-- please tag them -->

**Who will be using this data, and where (dashboards, snowflake UI, etc.)?**
