## Activities for the Requestor

* [ ] If this is your first time doing this, you will need access to the `snowflake_imports` GCS bucket.  Create an [access request](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/team-member-enablement/onboarding-access-requests/access-requests/#individual-or-bulk-access-request) the usual way.  Tag the `@gitlab-data/engineers` group in the access request when access is ready to be provisioned.
* [ ] Place usage ping payload files in the [`snowflake_imports` GCS bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/snowflake_imports) by clicking the `UPLOAD FILES` button, selecting the files, and pressing upload.
