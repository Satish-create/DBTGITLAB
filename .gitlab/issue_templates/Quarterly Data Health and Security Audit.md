# Quarterly Data Health and Security Audit

Quarterly audit is performed to validate security like right people with right access in environments (Example: Sisense, Snowflake.etc) and data feeds that are running are healthy (Example: Salesforce, GitLab.com..etc).

Please see the [handbook page](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/how-we-work/) for more information. 

Below checklist of activities would be run once for quarter to validate security and system health.

SNOWFLAKE
1. [ ] Validate terminated employees have been removed from Snowflake access.
    <details>

    Cross check between Employee Directory and Snowflake
    * [ ] If applicable, check if users set to disabled in Snowflake
    * [ ] If applicable, check if users in [roles.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/blob/master/permissions/snowflake/roles.yml):
        * [ ] isn't assigned to `warehouses`
        * [ ] isn't assigned to `roles`
        * [ ] can_login set to: `no`

    ```sql

      SELECT									 
        employee.employee_id,									 
        employee.first_name,									 
        employee.last_name,									 
        employee.hire_date,									 
        employee.rehire_date,									 
        snowflake.last_success_login,									 
        snowflake.created_on,									 
        employee.termination_date,									
        snowflake.is_disabled									 
      FROM prep.sensitive.employee_directory employee 									 
      INNER JOIN prod.legacy.snowflake_show_users  snowflake									 
      ON employee.first_name = snowflake.first_name									 
      AND employee.last_name = snowflake.last_name									 
      AND snowflake.is_disabled ='false'									 
      AND employee.termination_date IS NOT  NULL;									

    ```

2. [ ] De-activate any account that has not logged-in within the past 60 days from the moment of performing audit from Snowflake.
    <details>

    ```sql
     SELECT										
       employee.employee_id,										
       employee.first_name,										
       employee.last_name,										
       employee.hire_date,										
       employee.rehire_date,										
       snowflake.last_success_login,										
       snowflake.created_on,										
       employee.termination_date,										
       snowflake.is_disabled										
     FROM prep.sensitive.employee_directory employee										
     INNER JOIN  prod.legacy.snowflake_show_users snowflake										
     ON employee.first_name = snowflake.first_name										
     AND employee.last_name = snowflake.last_name										
     AND snowflake.is_disabled ='false'										
     AND employee.termination_date IS NULL										
     AND CASE WHEN snowflake.last_success_login IS null THEN snowflake.created_on ELSE snowflake.last_success_login END <= dateadd('day', -60, CURRENT_DATE());										
    ```
  

3. [ ] Validate all user accounts require multi-factor authentication.
    <details>

    * [ ] Check EXT_AUTHN_DUO is set to ‘false’ in users table. If set to ‘false’ then MFA is diabled.

SISENSE
1. [ ] Validate terminated employees have been removed from Sisense access.
    <details>




2. [ ] De-activate any account that has not logged-in within the past 90 days from the moment of performing audit from Sisense.

    <details>

     ```sql


    WITH FINAL AS (
       SELECT
          time_on_site_logs.user_id,
          users.first_name,
          users.last_name,
          MAX(date(time_on_site_logs.created_at)) AS last_login_date
       FROM time_on_site_logs
       INNER JOIN users
       ON time_on_site_logs.USER_ID = users.ID
       GROUP BY 1,2,3
    )

       SELECT * 
       FROM FINAL
       WHERE last_login_date < CURRENT_DATE-90 ;

   ```

3. [ ] Validate all user accounts require multi-factor authentication.


    <details>

     * [ ] Check “roles and policies” section under settings in Sisense. If 2FA is marked dash (--) for any user then two factor authentication is disabled.



TRUSTED DATA
1. [ ] Review all Golden Record TD tests and make sure they're passing.

    <details>

     ```sql

    SELECT *  
    FROM "PROD"."WORKSPACE_DATA"."DBT_TEST_RESULTS" 
    WHERE test_unique_id LIKE '%raw_golden_data%' 
    AND test_status <>'pass' 
    ORDER BY results_generated_at DESC ;				
				
    ```

2.  [ ] Review Data Siren to confirm known existence of RED data.

    <details>

     ```sql

    SELECT DISTINCT

3. [ ] Generate a report of all changes to the TD: Sales Funnel dashboard in the quarter.

    <details>

     * [ ]  Pull the report for business logic changes made to the mart from link (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/blame/master/transform/snowflake-dbt/models/marts/sales_funnel/mart_crm_opportunity.sql) by filtering on label “Business logic change”.
