{% docs prep_usage_ping %}
This data model will replace dim_usage_pings and version_usage_data in the future. This is currently a WIP! 

Dimension that contains demographic data from usage ping data, including additional breaks out for product_tier, if it is from an internal instance, and replaces the ip_address with country and adds two new date columns.

[Core represents both CE and EE](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/product-marketing/tiers/#history-of-ce-and-ee-distributions).

Get started by exploring the [Product Geolocation Analysis](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/data-catalog/product-geolocation/) handbook page.
Information on the Enterprise Dimensional Model can be found in the [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-ops/data-team/platform/edw/)
