{% docs rpt_ping_instance_metric_adoption_monthly_all %}

**Description:**  Estimated Usage Percents for All Reported Subscriptions and Subscriptions on Versions by Metric and Month  
- These estimations are used for determining usage for Implementations that do not send Service Pings. 
- Multiple Estimation methods are in this data and utilized by a Macro.   

**Data Grain:**
- ping_created_at_month
- metrics_path
- ping_edition
- estimation_grain

**Filters for Subscriptions on a Version:**
- Includes metrics for 28 Day timeframe
- Include metrics from pings with ping_delivery_type = 'self_managed'
- `Forwarded` - Include Metrics on Valid versions
- `Forwarded` - Metrics from GitLab Service Pings will not be considered
- `Forwarded` - Include Metrics from the 'Last Ping of the Month' pings

**Filters for All Reported Subscriptions:**
- `Forwarded` - Include ping_delivery_type = 'self_managed'
- `Forwarded` - Include metrics from pings with ping_delivery_type = 'self_managed'
- `Forwarded` - Includes metrics for 28 Day and All-Time timeframes
- `Forwarded` - Include only the `Last Pings of the Month`

**Business Logic in this Model:**
- There are multiple estimation Grains in this model
  - A macro is used to determine which `estimation_grain` to use from this report.  
- `estimation_grain` - tells which method is used to measure the `percent_reporting` %:
  - 'reported metric - seat based estimation' is from licensed_users seat counts
  - 'reported metric - subscription based estimation' is derived from subscription counts
- `percent_reporting` - reporting_count / (reporting_count + not_reporting_count) 
  - 'reporting_count' of Service Ping History (active Users or active Subscriptions)
  - 'not_reporting_count' not reporting for the Month (active Users or active Subscriptions)
- `Subscriptions on Valid Versions Estimate Percent Calculation`:
  - (Version Subscriptions) / (All Subscriptions Reporting + All Subscriptions Not Reporting) 
  - (Version Users) / (All Users Reporting + All Users Not Reporting)  
- `Subscriptions (All) Estimate Percent Calculation`:
  - (All Subscriptions) / (All Subscriptions Reporting + All Subscriptions Not Reporting) 
  - (All Users) / (All Users Reporting + All Users Not Reporting) 
- MRR, ARR and Licensed_User_Count is limited to:
  - product_delivery_type = `Self-Managed` 
  - subscription_status IN (`Active`,`Cancelled`)
  - product_tier_name <> `Storage`

**Other Comments:**
- Service Ping data is Sums, Counts and Percents of Usage (called metrics) along wth the Server Instance Configuration information is collected at a point in time for each Instance and sent to GitLab Corporate.  This is normally done on a weekly basis.  The Instance Owner determines whether this data will be sent or not and how much will be sent.  Implementations can be Customer Hosted (Self-Managed) or GitLab Hosted (referred to as SaaS or Dotcom data).  Multiple Instances can be hosted on Self-Managed Implementations like GitLab Implementations. 
- The different types of Service Pings are shown here for the [Self-Managed Service Ping](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#self-managed-service-ping) and the [GitLab Hosted Implementation Service Pings](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/saas-service-ping-automation/#saas-service-ping).
