# So a test has failed!

This document exists to capture common fixes for problems that may be surfaced by our dbt test suite. 

You will find the below document organized by test name, containing all documented errors for that test. 

**Most tests are meant to capture data quality concerns, so it's more important to investigate the cause of the failure than it is to remove the failure.**

## Types of test

There are two types of tests, `custom data tests` and `schema tests`. 

You can tell which kind of test this error was surfaced from by looking at the path at the end of the error message, if `tests/data_test/*` 
this is a `custom data test` which is defined as a .sql file in the `tests` folder, the compiled sql will be found in your `target/compiled/gitlab_snowflake/data_test` or `target/compiled/snowplow/data_test` folder.
 
If it's `models/*` this is a `schema test` and is defined in the `schema.yml` file on the model's folder and the compiled sql in the `target/compiled/gitlab_snowflake/schema_test` or `target/compiled/snowplow/schema_test` folder.


## General Checklist:
1. Make sure you are running the compiled code behind the test against `analytics` instead of your development schema
2. Verify that the error is valid by reviewing the data that is surfacing the error in the following order of priorities: test-failure --> model that was built powering test --> base model --> raw data
3. Go to the front-end of the data source and validate that it is not a data pipeline error
4. Create an issue in the Primary Data Project. If the issue needs to contain customer names or other private information ensure the issue is confidential

## Custom Data Tests

### Test: zuora_renewal_subscription_date_range

-----------
Error Example:
```
Failure in test zuora_renewal_subscription_date_range (tests/data_test/zuora_renewal_subscription_date_range.sql)
  Got 1 results, expected 0.

  compiled SQL at target/compiled/gitlab_snowflake/data_test/zuora_renewal_subscription_date_range.sq
```

Steps to Resolve:

* Step 1: Follow the general checklist
* Step 2: Create an issue in finance informing of the error and asking the account be updated. Cross link this to the analytics issue
* Step 3: Create an issue to remove the filter and assign it to the next milestone, cross-link it to the original issue
* Step 4: Filter out the zuora account in the base `zuora_account` model and submit your MR for review
* Step 5: Once finance has confirmed that the account has been updated, create a MR to remove the filter
-----------

### Test: zuora_account_has_crm_id

Error Example:
```
Failure in test zuora_account_has_crm_id (tests/data_test/zuora_account_has_crm_id.sql)
  Got 1 results, expected 0.

  compiled SQL at target/compiled/gitlab_snowflake/data_test/zuora_account_has_crm_id.sql

```

Steps to Resolve:

* Step 1: Follow the general checklist
* Step 2: Create an issue in finance asking the account get updated with a salesforce_id. Cross link this to the analytics issue
* Step 3: Create an issue to remove the filter and assign it to the next milestone, cross-link it to the original issue
* Step 4: Filter out the zuora account in the base `zuora_account` model and submit your MR for review
* Step 5: Once finance has confirmed that the account has been updated, create a MR to remove the filter


## Schema Tests

### Model: snowplow

Most snowplow errors can be resolved by triggering a full dbt refresh as the models are incremental, but sometimes have late-arriving events. Request a full refresh to @tmurphy in the #analytics-pipelines Slack channel.

Snowplow contains models and tests that are baked in from a Package (docs [can be found here](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/snowplow)), so make sure 
to check the compiled test (path found in the `compiled SQL` section of the error message) for test evaluation. 

Error Example:

```
Failure in test relationships_snowplow_web_events_time_page_view_id__page_view_id__ref_snowplow_web_page_context_ (models/page_views/schema.yml)
  Got 15164 results, expected 0.

  compiled SQL at target/compiled/snowplow/schema_test/relationships_snowplow_web_events_time_4183e7f72f68f16d48e4f78cd66a9c48.sql
