### Failed Snapshot

#### sheetload_employee_location_factor

If this snapshot fails due to a duplicate row, first confirm in the actual sheet that there is a duplicate. If so, create an issue in https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/people-ops/Compensation/issues and tag someone on PeopleOps, probably a People Operations Analyst, to address the issue.
